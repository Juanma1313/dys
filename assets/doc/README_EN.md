## Introduction

The DIY site is intended to be a repository of small-scale construction
projects, designed so that anyone can carry them out by following the
instructions posted on the repository in a genuine Do-It-Yourself style.

In this first phase of implementation, people of any age and skill level
can explore the projects named "Things" that are publicly presented in
this repository and use the project instructions to replicate them. The
contents of the projects (things) are entered into the repository by the
creators who require private access with certain privileges, assigned by
an administrator, in order to access the repository management system.

Public access to this website can be made completely anonymous, allowing
the users to browse the entire published repository, and encouraging
them to register on a permanent basis, which will also allow users to
mark which projects are their favourites.

From a technical standpoint, this site is implemented in Python,
JavaScript, HTML and CSS languages, on the Django framework and using
MVC design. It includes user authentication, email validation and full
CRUD functionality to manage the content of the repository.

In future phases of implementation, the options to publish content by
users from public access and the ability to sell their creations to
other users will be implemented. Advanced functions will also be added,
such as the search and filtering of projects based on content, or the
use of shopping carts, user profiles, payment gateways, etc.

## User experience (UX)

DIY Site aims to be a friendly public site for users to access DIY style
projects that they can replicate. The presentation of the content is
dynamic and attractive, and the information about the projects is clear
and easy to read.

Registered project creators will also be able to add and edit their own
creations. This administrative interface is geared towards a more
functional purpose, so that project content can be easily edited and
expanded.

### Functional specifications

#### The User

There are four types of users segregated by their role and purpose.

  - **Anonymous:** A non registered user

  - **Regular:** A registered user

  - **Creator:** A user with privileges to add/edit/publish content

  - **Administrator:** User that can validate users and perform all
    actions.

#### Goals

  - For all users, the user interface should be minimalistic and
    intuitive

  - For anonymous and regular users the user interface should be
    friendly, dynamic, clear and fun.

  - For Creators and administrators, The user interface should be clear,
    flexible and functional.

#### Customer requirements for users

The following are the customer requirements that are part of the user
stories list for the initial delivery iteration backlog.

when needed, meet a consensus between the developers and the project
owner through agreed acceptance criteria. Also, from a more technical
point of view, development tasks and their corresponding \`story
points\` are defined in order to better evaluate the development effort.
The following information lists all these issues. Please follow the

#### Web Site Sketches

To outline the design of the website, I have created the following
sketches to guide the development of the user interface. But, since for
the administration of the website I will mainly rely on the Django
administration interface, and even though it will be customized, I
didn't find the need to design the wireframes of those pages, since the
style is already defined in the framework and regular users will not
access it anyways.

For this type of website content, I assume that the authors will produce
descriptions and instructions with long texts, so the main design is
also oriented towards large screens. I then adapt this content so that
it can also be viewed by an eventual user of a small screen device.

##### ![](assets/media/image2.png)Base Page

This design only sketches the header and footer of the pages. This
should be consistent across all pages.

##### Home page and DIY projects list

This page is the landing page and displays a carousel of images and
phrases that define the website and shows the list of available DIY
projects as well as inviting the users to register to allow them to
select their favourite projects.

![](assets/media/image3.png)

#####   

##### DIY project Details

![](assets/media/image4.png)

#### Database

It is a customer requirement to use the services of Elephant as an
external SQL service to host the website database. This service provider
has servers running PostgreSQL servers.

Since the development framework is based on Django, we will use its
built in user management functionality from its allauth package.

Django's Allauth uses a database user table that its represented on the
leeft of the following figure, which is included in this figure tu
identify the relations with the website non built in database model.

![](assets/media/image5.png)

The table named \`diy\_thing\` stores the details of DIY projects and
DIY components. A special detail of the implementation is that this
table has a cyclic reference to itself in order to accommodate a tree
structure for the DIY components, which in turn are DIY projects
themselves.

The table named 'diy\_instructions' stores the details of the DIY
Project Instructions and a 'one-to-many' relationship with its
corresponding DIY Project.

The table called \`diy\_thing\_likes\` functions as an intermediate
table that stores references to all of each user's favourite DIY
Projects as a \`many to many\` relationship.

All these tables are automatically created by Django from the
application model classes \`Thing\` and \`Instructions\`, so with only
two classes, all the necessary database structure is created.

Although there is no specific class for the diy\_thing\_likes table, it
is also produced by Django when it recognizes the \`many-to-many\`
relationship in the \`Thing\` class in the application model.

## Features

#### Users Home page

The home page or landing page is presented on the root page of the
site's domain. Since the sole purpose of this website is to share
personal DIY projects, I designed it in a minimalist way with a single
carousel banner that explains the purpose of the site and a paginated
list of DIY projects available for sharing, where each of the DIY
projects is represented by a link showing its title, featured image,
author, time of publication and number of likes.

When an unregistered user browses the site, a link at the top of the
page encourages them to register and redirects them to the registration
page. On the other hand, if the user is already logged in, the link will
encourage them to view and rate the DIY projects, and this link will
redirect them to the list of DIY projects below..

![](assets/media/image6.png)

#### Footer

The main navigation bar appears at the top of all user web pages
containing links to the social media sites where the website owner have
presence.

![](assets/media/image7.png)

#### Users Navigation Bar

The main navigation bar appears at the top of all user web pages, and
maintains the minimalist style. It displays only the site's logo and
name, as a link to the home page, and a drop-down menu that allows the
user to access registration, login, logout and other functions.

The drop-down menu is located in the top right corner and is represented
by a user icon containing the user's name if signed in.

![](assets/media/image8.png)

##### User Dropdown Menu

This menu is located at the top right of the user's navigation bar, and
its drop-down content varies depending on the user's context.

###### User Menu options:

  - > **Sign Up:** This menu option redirects the user to the
    > accounts/registration web page so that he/she can self-register on
    > the website.

  - > **Sign In:** This menu option redirects the user to the
    > accounts/login webpage so that the user can sign in the website
    > with an email address

  - > **Sign Out:** This menu option redirects the user to the
    > accounts/logout webpage so that the user can sign out the website.

  - > **E-mail:** This menu option redirects the user to the
    > accounts/email webpage so that the user can self-manage his/her
    > email addresses.

  - > **Admin:** This menu option redirects the user to the admin web
    > page so that he/she can perform administrative tasks.

#### DIY Project details

Once the user has selected a DIY project link, the details web page is
displayed giving access to the details, the DIY components and the
Instructions, so that the user can follow them to reproduce the object
described in the project..

The layout of this page is highly dependent on the design of the DIY
project content creator, as the description fields and instructions are
displayed as HTML documents that can be fully customized with colours
and images, allowing for a very flexible result.The order in which the
information is presented is one of the few limitations that have been
set when displaying the DIY project.

![](assets/media/image16.png)

#### Administration pages

All the administrative tasks have been delegated to Django Allauth
extensions, wich brings a lot of development releaf, but also comes with
layout design limitations. Only the logo, website name and color schemas
are customized using a modified copy of the original Django Allouth
templates.

##### Content Creators homepage

This page gives the content creators access to all DIY project (Things),
individual instructions documents or any document attachment stored by
Django's Sumernote extension.

![](assets/media/image17.png)

##### DIY-Things webpage

This page provides a list of the DIY projects (Things) created. The
filter pannel will allow the creator to narrow down the list based on
its parent project, the published status and the creation date. We can
also search a particular text in the title or description text of the
DIY projects if we want to locate a particular project.

Marking the desired Things we can use the Delete/Publish/Set as draft
actions on any number of selected Things at once.

Clicking on any Thing's tytle from the list will present the Change
Thing page for the selected Thing, where all the DIY Project data can be
edited

![](assets/media/image18.png)

##### Change Thing webpages

This is probably the most complex administrative web page on this
website. It combines the functions of adding/deleting/modifying DIY
project details, components and instructions on a single page. It is
designed so that the Creator can manage the DIY project information
without having to navigate through many pages or make unnecessary
clicks.

Once you have made changes to your DIY Project, there are three ways to
save. Save all changes and return to the list, save all changes and
continue editing in the current DIY Project, or save all changes and
create a new blank DIY Project. Exiting this page or reloading without
saving, will immediately delete all changes made to the DIY Project.

On this web page we can distinguish three areas: the details of the DIY
Project at the top, followed by the list of components called "Things",
and at the bottom, the list of instructions called "Instructions".

![](assets/media/image19.png)

###### Change the DIY Project details

This upper area of the "Change Thing webpage" allows the content creator
to change the Title, the Author, and the Status (Draft/Published). It
allows also to assign a Featured Image that will be used in the list of
DIY Projects at the home page.

The most important element that can be modified in this area areis the
Description. This field has an embebded WSIWYG editor from the Django
Sumernote extension, that allows to insert text, images, videos, links
and any HTML/CSS needed to present the project. It is the responsability
of the creator to write a description that will be displayed correctly
to the final user .

![](assets/media/image20.png)

###### Change the DIY Project ***Components (Things)***

The DIY Components (Things) of a DIY Project (Thing) are in fact
themselves Thing elements, so they can also be edited like a normal DIY
Project. The only difference is that DIY Components have a "parent"
object to which they belong.

New DIY Components can be added using the "Add another Thing" link at
the bottom of the list.

![](assets/media/image21.png)

On the Change Thing web page, each of its DIY Components are listed
under "Things", and only their Title, Author, Status and Description are
shown. To minimize screen space and rendering time, the Description is
hidden by default, but can be displayed and edited using the \`show\`
link next to the 'DESCRIPTION' label.

![](assets/media/image22.png)

The rest of the information about a DIY component is not displayed, but
can be edited by clicking on the 'change' link next to the DIY component
name, which will bring up a new, separate modal Change Thing page for
this DIY component.

###### Change the DIY Project ***Instructions***

On the Change Thing website, each of your DIY Instructions is listed
under "INSTRUCTIONSS", and only its Title is displayed. To minimise
screen space and rendering time, the Description is hidden by default,
but can be displayed and edited using the \`show\` link next to the
'INSTRUCTIONS' label.

Note: The list name "INSTRUCTIONSS" is automatically created by Django
admin based on the name assigned to the class model. More research on
Django is needed to modify this name or further customize the layout of
the list.

The list of Instructions is ordered by Title. This is useful if you need
to maintain a particular order in the instructions, so assigning titles
such as "Step 01", "Step 02", etc. could be used to maintain a strict
order.

New Instructions elements can be added using the "Add another
Instructions" link at the bottom of the list.

![](assets/media/image23.png)

Instructions field, like the Description fields, has an embebded WSIWYG
editor from the Django Sumernote extension, that allows to insert text,
images, videos, links and any HTML/CSS needed to present the
instructions. It is the responsability of the creator to write a
Instructions element that will be displayed correctly to the final user
.

![](assets/media/image24.png)

The Instructions element can be also edited by clicking on the 'change'
link next to the DIY Instructions element title, which will bring up a
new, separate modal Change Instructions page.

##### DIY-Instructions webpage

This page provides a list of the Instruction items created, and is a
convenient way to access a particular Instruction item without having to
open the DIY Project to which it belongs.

The filtering panel will allow the creator to narrow down the list
according to their DIY Project (By Thing) or by the parent of the DIY
Project. It is also possible to search on a specific text in the title
or in the text of the DIY Project Instructions if we want to locate a
specific Instructions element.

By marking the desired Instruction items, the Delete action can be used
on any number of selected Instruction items at the same time.

Clicking on the title of any Instructions item in the list opens its
Change Instructions page, where the Instructions data can be edited.

![](assets/media/image25.png)

##### Change **<span class="underline">Instructions</span>** webpage

In this page Instructions item data can be edited.

Once all the required changes to the Instructions item have been made,
there are three ways to save the data. Save all changes and return to
the list, save all changes and continue editing in the current
Instructions item, or save all changes and create a new blank
Instructions item. Exiting this page or reloading without saving, will
immediately delete all changes made to the Instructions item.

![](assets/media/image26.png)

The Instructions field has an embebded WSIWYG editor from the Django
Sumernote extension, that allows to insert text, images, videos, links
and any HTML/CSS needed to present the instructions. It is the
responsability of the creator to write a Instructions element that will
be displayed correctly to the final user .

The Instructions elements are presented to the end user sorted by Title.
This is useful if a particular order needs to be maintained in the
instructions, so assigning titles such as "Step 01", "Step 02", etc.
could be used to maintain a strict order. Special care should be taken
when changing the Title, as it may affect the order in which the
instructions are presented to the end-user.

##### Administrators webpage

This web page is only available when the user is an administrator, and
provides full access to all website settings.

This documentation only shows the main admin page, as the DIY pages are
the same as described for content creators, and the rest can be found in
the Django documentation.

## Future Enhancements

In the current project it is assumed that content creation is done by
administrators and staff, who have unrestricted access to all content in
the system, and that users can only browse a master list of DIY
projects. In a future implementation, the following capabilities would
be desired:

  - Users should be able to browse the list of their favorite DIY
    Projects

  - The list of DIY projects should be prioritised based on user
    ratings.

  - Users should be able to filter and search the DIY project database

  - Projects should be clasified by DIY Project type

  - Users should be able to comment on any DIY Project

  - There should be a moderator function, automatic or manual, to
    validate and control user comments.

  - Users should be able to loging using their social networks accounts

  - The user should be able to exchange messages directly with other
    users.

  - Users should be able to upload and modify their own DIY projects by
    becoming content creators.

  - Users should be able to modify their own DIY projects

  - A shopping bag should be implemented for user to buy published
    DIY-Projects

  - A online payment system should be added to the website.

  - Grant access to free content and restrict user access to pay per
    view content

  - Users should be able to put a price on their DIY projects

  - Users should be able to buy DIY Projects

  - Users should be able to receive compensation for their DIY projects
    sold.

  - Users should have the option to donate for any free shared content

## Testing

### Testing Strategy

Since the webpages for the unknown or regular users that are the
webpages handled from scratch by the project which are minimalistic and
simple, and the administrative pages are mostly handled by a well tested
Django Allauth extensions, I decided that a manual testing strategy for
the application can be easier to deploy and more effective in terms of
time and human efforts.

As for the code validation, I use online applications to check that the
source code for all the languages used are in line with the required
standards.

### Validating the Source

#### Django Python code

In order to validate the python code as PEP8 compliant, I have run it
througt "CI Python Linter" online tool and checked the results

The only PEP8 error I systematically allow is the "E501 line too long".
This is a personal decision and the reason I allow this error is because
nowadays developers' monitors no longer have a limit of 80 characters
per line and following this rule is extremely annoying for me.

| x            | views.py    | 2 errors - E501 Line too long  | x    | E501 ignored    |

#### CSS code

In order to validate the CSS code, I tried to pass the url of the
deployed website to the CSS validator from W3C, but there where many
warnings related to the many third party extensions used by Bootstrap
and others.

I decide to validate only the style.css file that is really the only one
I have customized. The result is as follows:

![](assets/media/image28.png)

Unfortunately the result is in spanish, but translates to
"Congratulations\!, No errors found" and "This document is CSS version 3
+ SVG Valid\!",

The validator only reported 2 warnings regarding two features from a
vendor extension, which its no problem.

#### HTML code

In order to validate HTML, I pass the deployed website urls that I want
to test to the HTML validator from W3C.

![](assets/media/image29.png)

### Testing the application

Most of the bugs have been detected and fixed in the development
process. And Deployment in Heroku counts for me as a Smoke Test for the
application. Then all the specific features can be tested.

In order to test most of the developed features, I created a list of
test cases to run in the deployed website

#### The development environment 

For the development of this application the following list of
frameworks, services and resources where used

  - > Microsoft Visual Studio Code v1.87 for linux was used as de IDE
    > for the development.

  - > Git was used for version control and file transfer between the IDE
    > and the repository in GitHub.

  - > GitHub is the online service that stores the development project

  - > Moqups.com is the online service I used to create the UI sketches
    > for the website

  - > GIMP 2.10 used for all the image manipulation.

  - > PGAdmin IV was used to verify and generate the ERD representation
    > for the SQL database

  - > Django v3.2.24 was used for the runtime frameworks

  - > Bootstrap v5.3.3 is used for the front end development as a CDN
    > service

  - > ElephantSQL is the online service that hosts the SQL database for
    > development and the deployed version

  - > Cloudinary is the online service that hosts the media files for
    > the deployed version

  - > Fontawesome is the service that provides with fonts and icons as a
    > CDN service

  - > Heroku is the online service that hosts the web site for the
    > deployed version.

#### Resources

  - > Ghithub online documentation

  - > The Django and its extensions (Allauth, Sumernote, etc) online
    > documentation

  - > The HTML and CSS documentation

  - > Bootstrap 5 online documentation

  - > The Code Institute reference material.

## Deployment

The site was deployed via Heroku. Access the site using the following
link -[<span class="underline">DIY
Site</span>](https://dys-1c0dad79f0a0.herokuapp.com/)

For the deployment in Heroku, we assume that the media files server and
the database server is already defined and a base database is restored
from a backup. Otherwise, the process of deployment must be done using a
development environment first, and use the fixtures from Django to
populate the database with the minimum information. In that scenario,
first clonning the repository could be a better choice.

### How to deploy the project on Heroku

1.  Sign up / Log in to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

2.  From the main Heroku Dashboard page select 'New' and then 'Create
    New App'

3.  Give the project a name and select the region, then select create
    app.
    
    I used ‘dys’ as the name for my Heroku app

4.  Once finished creating the app, navigate to the setting tab, and
    select the \`Reveal Config Vars\` in the config vars section. And
    create the following variables:
    
      - ALLOWED\_HOSTS = \[the address for the deployed application
        host\]
        
        usually, after the deployment, this variable can be found in the
        application Settings tab, under Domains section
    
      - DEVELOPMENT = False
        
        This is a very important variable. If it is not present, the
        application will asume False, but if it is specifically set to
        True, the deployed application will be in debug mode, and could
        be vulnerable for hackers.
    
      - SECRET\_KEY = \[your secret key\]
        
        With Python, get\_random\_secret\_key() from
        django.core.management.utils can be used to create this variable
    
      - DATABASE\_URL =\[your database service url\]
        
        This variable is provided by the database server, in my case its
        ElepantSQL. And it looks like :
        
        “postgres://kjsdhf:sdfçsdafsadfsdfg987dgfs987fdg@dumbo.db.elefantsql.com/kjsdhf”
    
      - CLOUDINARY\_URL = \[your media file service url\]
        
        This variable is provided by the media files server, in my case
        its Cloudinary. And it looks like :
        
        “cloudinary://826348763248682436:5dc5sd5f5sdf5fd5dfs5@klhjsadkhdfsag”
    
      - EMAIL\_HOST = \[your email service host\]
        
        In my case I use google host “smtp.gmail.com”
    
      - EMAIL\_HOST\_USER = \[your website email account username\]
        
        in my case I use “pruebasdeprogramacion13@gmail.com”
    
      - EMAIL\_HOST\_PASSWORD = \[your website email account password\]
        
        Be careful with his password, because some email service
        providers do not support user password, but a special
        application password.
        
        This variables would have to be defined in the env.py file of
        the project if the application runs in the local computer of a
        development environment.

5.  In Heroku, navigate to the “Deploy” tab and use the option “GitHub
    (connect to GitHub)”
    
    Scroll down and click on “Connect to GitHub”
    
    In the repository search option, type the name of this repository or
    your own repository name if you have cloned it, and then use the
    “Connect” option and wait for the new “Deploy Branch” option
    appear.
    
    Use the “Deploy Branch” option and wait until the deployment is

    earlier.

#### Create a clone of this repository

Creating a clone enables you to make a copy of the repository allowing
you to run the application in your local development environment:

1.  Navigate to [This repository](https://github.com/Juanma1313/dys)

2.  click on the arrow on the green ‘code’ button at the top of the list
    of files

3.  select the ‘HTTP’ option to clone using the web URL and copy the URL
    to your clipboard.

4.  At you local computer, use the console and change your directory to
    the disk directory where you want the application to be cloned.

5.  At the console prompt, type 'git clone ' and paste the https link
    from your clipboard, followed by enter

6.  once the git command has finished, you should have a local copy of
    the repository that can be opened by a IDE of your choice and for
    example, push it to a new repository in GitHub to deploy it from
    your own repository
