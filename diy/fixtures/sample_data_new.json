Due to this the fume extractor has to be very close to the area where we are soldering, making it inconvenient to use, and in the end, we end up never using it. For this reason, for my fume extractor I bought a very powerful fan, that is able to remove the soldering fumes even if the extractor is around 30 cm from the soldering iron. Of course, the fact that the fan is very powerful also means that it is far more noisy than a PC fan, so that is something that needs to be taken into account. The fan runs on 12V, and having a power of 10W consumes about 800 mA</p><hr><p style=\"text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2; margin-left: 25px;\"><br></p>"

However, I like to take great care of the aesthetics and design of my projects. So I spent some time designing on Fusion 360 the various parts with which I will build the fume extractor, to make it resemble a professional tool. I 3D printed all the parts, using black and orange PLA, following the color scheme of Black&amp;Decker tools. The STL files for 3D printing are below.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2; color: rgb(85, 85, 85); font-family: myriad-pro, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size: 14px;\">The parts that need to be 3D printed include the box in which the fan will be placed, the base, in which the power switch will be put, and its cover. I also printed the two grids that will be used to mount the filter, a small border and other parts, including two knobs, four feet and two spacers.<br><br></p><hr>"

We could leave the original two wires from the fan, but in my opinion the look of them is a bit too thin and they do not fit well the design. So I cut the positive (red) and negative (black) wires of the fan quite short and soldered them to the two wires of a microphone audio cable, which is thicker and therefore in my opinion adds something to the final aesthetics. It is important to note here that I chose that cable just because I had it lying around, but every thick cable with at least two pins should work fine. I protected the soldering with heat shrink tubing, and by drilling a hole in the plastic reinforcement of a side of the fan I was able to fit the connection in one of its corners.<br><br><br></p><hr>"

These bolts will be used to attach the fan to the stand while allowing us to adjust the angle of the fan, and they will be locked by the fan once it is mounted. After running the cable through the hole, I inserted the fan into the 3D printed piece, holding the air outlet to the outside.

After cutting, I filed the edges of the aluminium profiles. In both pieces I drilled two 6 mm holes, one 30 mm from one side and the other one 10 mm apart from the other side. To make the holes more precisely, I used a cheap drill press, but a cordless drill should work fine too.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2; color: rgb(85, 85, 85); font-family: myriad-pro, helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">I attached the two aluminium pieces to the two sides of the base, with two M6 bolts with round head; the small channel on each side of the base will keep them right-angle, without the need of using two bolts.

First, I stripped the cable that goes from the fan into the base. Next to the switch I also decided to put a status LED, both because on electronic devices there is always an LED and because it looks cool. I chose a blue LED, and soldered a 1 K resistor to the positive leg for limiting the current. To power the LED I soldered a positive wire to the resistor, and a negative wire to the negative leg of the LED. I mounted the LED in a hole I made in the base and fixed it with some hot glue.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2; color: rgb(85, 85, 85); font-family: myriad-pro, helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Then I soldered the positive of the fan along with the positive of the LED to one of the two pins of the switch.

After finding positive and negative on the connector with a digital multimeter, I connected the negative of the fan and the negative of the LED to the negative of the connector, and to the positive I soldered the wire coming from the switch.

In today's guide, I will show you how I made an <font color=\"#000000\" style=\"\"><b>extractor for soldering iron fumes</b></font>. In fact, if you do electronics projects or with Arduino, at some point you will need to do some soldering. </p><p>I use the soldering iron in almost all of my projects, either to mount components on a board or to connect wires together. You will surely have noticed that the soldering iron produces some fumes, which are certainly not particularly healthy to breathe. </p><p>So, I decided to build an extractor for the fumes that are produced by the soldering iron, which is also capable of filtering them with an activated carbon filter. This project is quite simple and inexpensive, and in my opinion it is also very useful.</p>",

In today's guide, I'll show you how to make a <b>Bassoon Reed Dryer.</b> In fact, if you play the bassoon you will realize how often the reeds wear out, and these are not cheap at all. So, chances are, you'll want to make your own. And that's where this project comes in to help you.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The bassoon reed dryer is an essential tool for bassoon players who make their own reeds. Once the reed has been finished and varnished, it is placed on one of the spikes or mandrels, where it is left to rest until it is ready for use. The effect is that the reed is not deformed in the embouchure or in the opening of the tudel, maintaining the right shape for its final use.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>I hope you find it easy to build and useful.</b></p>",
